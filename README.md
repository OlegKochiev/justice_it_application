Justification of the use of libraries:
1 - Chart.js - Among the many charting libraries for JavaScript application developers, Chart.js is currently the most popular according to GitHub stars (~60,000 downloads) and npm (~2,400,000 per week).
Chart.js was created and announced in 2013, but has come a long way since then. It is an open source program licensed under a very permissive MIT license, and is supported by an active community.
